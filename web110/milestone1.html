			<dt><strong>What is the purpose of the site? What do you want the web site to accomplish? What opportunity, problem, or issue is your site addressing?</strong></dt>
				<dd> I will provide book reviews and literary culture for fiction and non-fiction readers. This site will specifically address the lack of non-fiction book blogs and celebrate non-fiction works.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Who is your intended audience? Be specific.</strong></dt>
				<dd> My audience will be readers of all sorts but will cater to non-fiction readers and books. Target audience will be in the age range of 20+ and will be those who are lifelong learners and info-maniacs.</dd>
			<dt><strong>What type of content might be included in your site? Be specific.</strong></dt>
				<dd> I will include a "What im reading" section which will include updates during my reading as well a photo of the book. The site will have Fiction and Non-Fiction book reviews. The reviews could include youtube video links to more reviews of the book. I would also like to start a organizational structure for different types of nonfiction books. </dd>
