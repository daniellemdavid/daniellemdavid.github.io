		<h1>Danielle's Course Contract</h1>
	</header>
	
	<main>
		<p>I, Danielle David agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Summer web110_85 Internet/Web Fundamentals with my instructor, D. I. von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
		<p>Signed: Danielle David, 05/30/2020</p>
