	<main>
		<p>I, <a href ="introduction.html"> Danielle David </a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Summer web110_85 Internet/Web Fundamentals with my instructor, D. I. von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
